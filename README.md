# Nightcore_Maker

This script creates a nightcore version wav file and a video including an image with the same nightcore version from the input mp3 file.

I created this script because creating a nightcore version out of a song was taking so much time, at a beginning it was not the big deal, but doing that with more than 20 songs became boring and taking so much time, now with this script you can put as much songs as you want and do them all at the same time with just a few clicks, then check each one to see if you like that version and also have a video that looks like almost all youtube nightcore song videos.

If this is the first time using this script, make sure that the function env_check is being called inside the py file, this will check if the needed directories are available and if not, create them, then just put the desired mp3 files inside the root folder and run the script.

If you have any issue with the script I would appreciate you to let me know, so I can fix it and improve the script with more and new features

Feel free to suggest any change to the script, we can make this script better :)
